TDD & BDD


    - Test Driven Development


    - it is a development approach


    - Developemnt will happen based on test cases

    
    - test cases are written in advance


    - code should pass all the test cases


     TDD cycle

         - Write the test

         - Make it run
 
         - Change the code to make it right i.e., refactor

         - Repeat the process

     



BDD

    - Behavioural Driven Developement


    - it is a development approach


    - here we create scenarios which is understandable for all the stakeholders(dev, testers, analyst)


    - it is like a common english language



Gherkin Keywords


     Feature - it refers to business Requirement

     Scenario - Validation to be performed

     Given - Pre condition

     When - it refers the interaction between user and the system

     Then - Expected result(what the system is suppose to do?)
    

     
    
    Login screen


    Feature   - To test the login screen

    Scenario  - test with valid and invalid user credentials(username and password)

    Given     - The login page should be launched

    When      - users enters valid username and password

                user enters valid username and invalid password

                user enters invalid username and valid password

                user enters invalid username and invalid password 

    And      -  user clicks the Submit/OK button
    
    Then     -  what should be the systems response (expected result) 

    And      - it is like a extension used with when,Then keyword                
                  
             For example:

                    when : users enters valid username and password

                    And  : user clicks the submit / ok button


                    Then : system should accept the input and allow to login

          
                    And  : system should display the inbox / dashboard



Cucumber 


    - it is a BDD framework that is implemented using Gherkins

    
    - For an example webdriver script related to launching a browser 

    - with the  help annotations we can describe the scenario



Feature  - refers to the business requirement

Scenario - Functionality

Given    - refers to the test condition

When     - refers to the test descriptions

Then     - refers to the expected result



 3 Ways to install cucumber eclipse plugins


     i.   Eclipse MarketPlace

     ii.  Install New Software

     iii. Maven Dependency(easiest)

















features
         - it defines the business requirement

step definition

         - it defines the selenium webdriver code implementation using java

runner class

        - it refers to TestNG program where we execute the script



How to install?


    - Download plug-in from Eclipse marketplace

    - Download jar files 

    - Download maven dependency 


TestNG is mandatory for Cucumber
