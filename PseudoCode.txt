IF condition statement THEN
    if body
ELSE IF condition THEN
    else if statement
ELSE
    else body
ENDIF

Example 1:
---------

age = INPUT : “Enter your age”
IF age is greater than 18
    PRINT “adult”
ELSE
    PRINT “Under age”


FOR initial_value TO end_value
    for body
ENDFOR

FOR i -> 0 to 20
    PRINT i
ENDFOR

Example for Rectangle

BEGIN
    length = INPUT: "Enter the length of the rectangle"
    width  = INPUT: "Enter the width of the rectangle"

    area = length * width

    OUTPUT area
END


WHILE condition
    while body

ENDWHILE


i : 0
WHILE i  <= 20
    PRINT i
ENDWHILE


FUNTION function_name(parameters)
    function body
    RETURN value

ENDFUNCTION
Example:

FUNTION add( para1, para2 )
    result: para1+para2
    RETURN result
ENDFUNCTION add



Increases the code readability.
Provides the best way to write algorithms.
More than specific syntax focuses on the program logic.
The best approach to represent how the actual program will be written.


Use capital words for reserved commands or keywords, for example, if you are writing IF…ELSE statements then make sure IF and ELSE be in capital letters.
Write only one statement per line.
Use indentation for the block body. It keeps the body of every component isolated and indenting different pieces of each block will indicate that those pieces of pseudocode go under a less intended section.
Be specific while writing a statement, use plain English to provide a particular description.
