Levels of Testing
          

     - Unit Level
           
            - Done by the developers at every module
    
            - Junit, Nunit, TestNG


     - Integration Level 

            - Done by developers/ testers

            - Combining modules and testing it together

            - Two sub levels
                     
                - component level integration --->  check for the interface/ connectivity(JDBC/ODBC)
 
                - system level integration ---> check whether data is passed properly from one to                                                                                      another  module(flow)

                                 

     - System Level

                - Functional and Non-functional testing is done


                - Functional  ---> it checks the logical flow of the software
                                   
                                   check whether the software works as per the instruction or not

                                   Ex: the corresponding page should appear on clicking the link

                                       amazon.in  --> opens homepage of amazon

                - Non-Functional ----> it checks how much time it took to execute an instruction
                (Performance & Security)                        
                                        Ex:time taken to launch the homepage of website amazon.in  

                                        how much secure is the software(passwords, authentication, firewalls) 

   
     - Acceptance Level

                   - UAT
                         --> User Acceptance Testing

                             Done by the client (BFSI-Banking Financial Services and Insurance)  
                             Ex: A Banker will do UAT 

                             Client test the software andd shares feedback
                             
                             Developemnt & Testing team will work on the feedback


                   - OAT/FAT
                        
                         ---> Operational Acceptance Testing / Field Acceptance Testing  

                              Done by the end-user

                              It is done after depolying the softare in client location(Production Environment)
                            
                              Ex: for a banking software ATM point   
                                 
                       

        Infosys  -- IT solution Provider


        Canara Bank -- Client 


        Customers of Bank -- end users  


      
 A seperate Test Plan and a Test Strategy is maintained 


  Unit Test Plan

  Integration Test Plan

  Security Test Plan

  Acceptance Test plan


 Types of Testing
      Acceptance - Done by client and end-user

      Adhoc - Done with not clear (partial)requirements      

      Alpha - Done by client at developers location   

      Behavioural - Black box testing(logical flow is tested by testers)

      Beta - Done by end user at trial period 

      Compatibility - Test the sofware in different environment(h/w,s/w, o/s, browser)

      comparison - Test the strength and weakness of the software with its previous version

      Depth - Detailed Test on the software 

      End-to-end - Test the software in a environment that resmbles the real environment(Simulation process)

                    Ex: Jmeter, Loadrunner

      functional Testing - Logical Flow of the software 

      Gorilla Testing - Heavy testing is done on a particular feature

      Incremental integration - Integrate parallely and no need to wait 

      Monkey - Testing is done randomly 

      Load - Test the softare under its limit(by gradually increasing the load)

      Regression - Test after the fixes or enhancements or modification in the software. Check for side effects

      Re-Testing - Here test the software after fixes(Debugging). side effects are not tested.

      Sanity - Primary level testing(here test the basic functionality)
               if the software fails for basic usage then sanity test fails
      Smoke  - After changes or modifications in the software. smoke testing is done.

               Sub set of regression testing

      Stress - Testing the software beyond its limit
                
               Overloading the software to know the breakpoint. 

      Usability - Test the user friendliness(GUI Standards) of the software 


      Volume - Test the software with large amount of data 

      white box - here testing is done on the code.

                  also called as Structural testing
      

    
    Traceability matrix - it maps the requirement to corresponding test case


    Entry Criteria - it is the pre-requisites

    Exit Criteria  - make sure all requirement are met









      
Bug - Raised by QA team

    - before software is released

    - Deviation from Expected result


Defect - Raised by the Client

       - after software is released

       - Deviation from Expected result


Failures - it is visible to the end user

         - if it fails to meet the end user need

Quality

        - both technical and financial requirements 

        - Delivering a product on time that meets end user requirement

Quality Assurance

         - It is the process of defect avoidance     

         - Plan, Monitor and Control

         - makes sure that testing is done as per the plan

         - meet deadlines, set standards

Quality control
   
         - it is the process of defect detection

         - here defects will be identified and reported to development team to fix


Verfication and Validation

       Verifying - whether the software works or not


       Validation -- whether the software works as per the client requirements 


                  -- check length and data type
