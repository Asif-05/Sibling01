Testing Methodology
-------------------

   - Manual Testing
    
       - Here testing is done by the without help of any automation tools

       - Manual Test Cases, Bug reports are prepared 

       - Documentation skills are needed

       - It is done on mandatory basis
       

Advantage 
 
       - It is easy to follow and implement

       - Flexible to test

 
Disadvantges 

      - Domain knowledge is mandatory

      - Time consuming process

      - less efficient(prone to human errors-typo errors)


   - Automation Testing

       - it is done with the help of automation testing tools

      
    When to automate?

      - it is done when the requirements are not stable

      - when the process involves lots of repetation

    
    where to automate?

  
       - When we test huge and complex data

       - less time constraint


  Advantage
  
        - takes less time duration to complete the testing phase
     
      
        - highly effiecint(can avoid human liable errors)

    
        - can handle dynamic data efficiently


  Disadvantage


        - Need programming skills(Core Java, C#, Java Script, Python)


        - Tools are expensive to deploy and maintain


        - Should do a lot of CBA(Cost Benefit Analysis)

      
   Category of automation tools

             - Vendor based tool(licensed)

                    - Tools that are marketed by a company(HP, IBM) 
           
             - Open source(Free)

                      - Download it for free (Selenium, Jmeter)
            
             - Customized

                      - which is customized(edited based on needs) and  by the company itself 

                      - Internal tools

 Types of Tools


     Functional  - logical flow(HP UFT/QTP,Selenium, IBM's RFT)


     Non Functional - performance(HP's Loadrunner, Jmeter) and security


     Bug tracking   - Bugzilla( Can only write bug reports and test cases are not allowed)


     Test Management  - Here we can design both bug reports and test cases
