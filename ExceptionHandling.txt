Exception


     - it is an error

     - it disrupts the normal flow of execution

     - java compiler will create an object whenever an exception is thrown   

Types

     - Checked 

           - it happens at the compile time 

           - it should be handled using try catch block  
  

     - Unchecked 
     
           - it happens at the run time 

           - No need to handle unchecked exceptions


For example:

      10 lines of code


      error happens at 6th line 


      remaining 4 lines will not be executed



  try-catch mechanism will help in executing the remaining lines of code

  it will handle the interruption(exception/error) and allow the normal flow of execution
